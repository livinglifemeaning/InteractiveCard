- Oh my goodness forms are difficult. If there's any project to come back and refactor its this one because my code is not DRY at all. I think a useReducer function in the store.js would help a little bit. Maybe storing the redux values in an object would be good too. This is why people use libraries, but I wanted to figure out the logic myself.
